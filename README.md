Peer-reviewed assignments for Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis course

## Steps for peer reviewers:

* First: download and unzip data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip into your working directory.

* Run R-script 'tidydata.R'. This will load the dataset into memory, select the entries we are interested in and combine the date and time column into a single datetime column.

* Run respectively 'plot1.R', 'plot2.R', 'plot3.R' and 'plot4.R' to get the requested png figure.
